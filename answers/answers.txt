Description: In this project, you will apply many of the concepts you have learnt in this course to analyze two competing popular soda brands, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. You will need to perform a sentiment analysis of the two brands. You also need to parse sentences into parts of speech and extract the Top 100 nouns, verbs, adjectives (of all types) and hashtags by occurrence. In addition to the specific outputs, answer and summarize with the data, the following questions:




1. Which brand has more positive sentiment (and by how much: quantify)?

######## FROM sentimentanalysis-output.txt
Printing stats for Coke ...
Mean -  0.132764731159
Median -  0.106349206349
Mode -  ModeResult(mode=array([ 0.]), count=array([16932]))

Printing stats for Pepsi ...
Mean -  0.0892925421533
Median -  0.0266666666667
Mode -  ModeResult(mode=array([ 0.]), count=array([10885]))
########

Coke's mean sentiment is greater than Pepsi's by 0.0434721890057
Coke's median sentiment is greater than Pepsi's by 0.0796825396823

The median is most likely a better measure than mean because of the overwhelming amount of non-polar sentiments from the sentiment analysis algorithm. Regardless, Coke definitely has a much better positive perception than Pepsi. (by 4%)





2. What attributes of the product are the reasons why the perception is more positive? (Hint: use specific Parts of Speech)

Coke +
------
dieting, coke zero, weight loss, healthy
fashion, nature

recent campaigns such as #FootballWithCocaCola, #FIFAU17WC, #FIFATrophyExperience

Pepsi +
-------

apocalypse - someone released a DOOM fan game with pepsi in it
Kendall Jenner - insensitive ad released earlier 2017
#PepsiGladiators, BritneySpears, EnriqueIglesias, Pink, Beyonce - old commercial they did
stuff about fetuses, flesh, aborted, etc.
memes - usually related to the Kendall Jenner ad






3. What attributes of each product are the top contributors for their negative perception? (Hint: use specific Parts of Speech)

Coke -
------
Selena Quintanilla–Pérez. She was a famous singer who was murdered years ago. Someone posted an old photoshoot of her in a coke ad.
indigenous - Coke put out an ad with giving indigenous people coke, which got backlash. This was in 2015.

Pepsi -

Reporting any additional interesting patterns/finds in the data is highly recommended.

In general, Coke is a lot more boring. There's not too much going on with their brand on twitter. Pepsi on the other hand is dealing with a lot more PR issues which make for interesting research. Despite some PR issues being almost a year old, they're still one of Pepsi's most frequent words.

That said, all the tweet data given to us was between Sept and Oct 2017. Many of the highest trending tweets were based on somewhat recent events or an old event with a resurgance of retweets. Our understanding is that positive and negative factors that stick out are very time dependent.
