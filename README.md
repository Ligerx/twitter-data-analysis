# Twitter Data Analysis
For our data science class, we analyzed a data set of tweets of Coke and Pepsi from Sept/Oct 2017. We wanted to figure out which brand was preferred and why.

We used sentiment analysis to figure out how people on twitter generally felt about the two brands. We then used POS tagging to find the top words and hashtags that contributed to those sentiments.
